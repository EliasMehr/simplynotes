### Presentation of project
The idea of creating a REST API service that allows us to be posting notes and converting notes into Todoos.
Thereafter we liked the idea of combining the notes and todos into a tool that we can used under an appointment.
The idea itself isn't complex but the challenging part for us was to implement Security, creating a friend-list and 
mimic the real world working environment to achieve experience how professional software developers do.

The idea was to combine all experience under our school period and work with the knowledge that we have.
We've learned by our own intresses spring security, react, postgreSQL, heroku and JWT which we did NOT
learn under our school period.
